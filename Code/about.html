                <p>As a web developer, my Python skills are one of my strongest assets. 
                    I have extensive experience in working with Python to build robust and scalable 
                    web applications, and I am constantly learning and staying up-to-date with the latest 
                    best practices and trends.</p>

            <div class="skill skill-2">
                <h3>TypeScript</h3>
                <p>I am well-versed in TypeScript's integration with popular front-end frameworks 
                    such as Angular and React, allowing me to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces. 
                    I have experience in leveraging TypeScript to build complex data-driven web applications, 
                    and I am adept at using its powerful features to optimize performance and enhance the user 
                    experience.</p>

            <div class="skill skill-3">
                <h3>React</h3>
                <p>I have experience in leveraging React to build complex and data-driven user interfaces, 
                    and I am able to integrate it with other technologies such as Redux and React Router 
                    to create powerful and dynamic web applications. I am well-versed in using React's various 
                    features such as hooks, context API, and server-side rendering to optimize performance and 
                    enhance the user experience.</p>
